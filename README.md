personal expense manager web app

I have used XAMPP localhost server for sql. To download XAMPP, visit https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
After installing the software, go to the installed directory, go to xampp->htdocs, create a new folder there, lets say "test".

Now download all the files I have uploaded here and place them in that folder, run the localhost server and visit: localhost/test in your 
browser.

# Database details: 
  I have used sql database and phpmyadmin, so there should be one user with the below details in your phpmyadmin and the following table  to for the web app to work.
   Details: <br>$servername = "localhost";<br>
            $username = "localhost";<br>
            $password = "";<br>
            $dbname = "test";<br>
            
upload the expense.sql file given here in database named "test" and you are good to go.
